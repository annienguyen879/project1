## Data Wrangling, Exploration, Visualization

### Annie Nguyen (ahn539)

#### Introduction 

The women's rights movement has made great strides since the late 19th century. Literacy rates for girls have continued to rise, and the world is  beginning to witness women assume higher positions of power. For many years, women's representation in government has been sparse, but because of better access to education, today there is stronger female representation in Congress and in Parliaments across the globe. 

This project analyzes the change in literacy rates for girls by country and examines the progress of women's representation in government. The `years` data set contains the mean number of years women (aged 15 to 44) were in school; the `ratio` data set contains the percent ratio of girls to boys in primary and secondary education; the `parliament` data set denotes the percentage of women in parliamentary positions. Each observation is recorded by country and year.

```{R}
library(tidyverse)
library(gt)
years <- read_csv("mean_years_in_school.csv")
ratio <- read_csv("ratio_girls_to_boys_in_school_perc.csv")
parliament <- read_csv("wn_bothhouses_c.csv")
```

#### Tidying: Reshaping

The data sets were tidied using the `pivot_longer` function. The data for years were pivoted, and the values column was renamed to their respective variable name.

```{R}
years %>% pivot_longer(-1, names_to='year', values_to='mean_yrs') ->years
ratio %>% pivot_longer(-1, names_to='year', values_to='ratio') -> ratio
parliament %>% pivot_longer(-1, names_to='year', values_to='perc_parliament') -> parliament
```

    
#### Joining/Merging

```{R}
years %>% summarise(countries=n_distinct(country), years=n_distinct(year))
ratio%>% summarise(countries=n_distinct(country), years=n_distinct(year))
parliament %>% summarise(countries=n_distinct(country), years=n_distinct(year))
```
Before joining, the `years` data set has 7000 observations, `ratio` has 10,200 observations, and the `parliament` data set has 14,668 observations. In the `years` data set, there are 175 distinct countries, 200 countries in the `ratio` set, and 193 countries in the `parliament` set. 

```{R}
setdiff(years$country,ratio$country)
setdiff(ratio$country,years$country)

setdiff(years$country,parliament$country)
setdiff(parliament$country,years$country)

setdiff(ratio$country,parliament$country)
setdiff(parliament$country,ratio$country)
```
Using the `setdiff` function one can identify which countries from the first set is not in the second set. The listed countries above represent countries from the first data set that were excluded from the second. 

```{R}
inner_join(years,ratio) %>% inner_join(parliament) %>% summarise(n_distinct(country))
```
Across the three data sets, they share 170 countries in common.

```{R}
full_join(years,ratio) %>% full_join(parliament)->join

join %>% filter_at(vars(mean_yrs,ratio,perc_parliament),any_vars(!is.na(.))) -> joined_data
glimpse(joined_data)
```

The three data sets are joined by country and year using the full_join function in order to retain as many relevant data points as possible. However, rows where there are no data available for all three variables are filtered out. After filtering the data, 3,562 observations were dropped.

####  Wrangling

```{R}
joined_data %>% mutate(country=str_replace_all(country,'[- ]','')) %>% select(-year) %>% group_by(country) %>% summarise_all(function(x) mean(x,na.rm = T)) %>% arrange(-perc_parliament)
```

Grouping the data by countries, each column averages the available data points to yield the overall average for 'mean years in school,' 'ratio of girls to boys in school,' and the 'percent of women in parliamentary position,' respectively. The data were then re-arrange to show the countries with the highest percentage of women in parliament in descending order. Outputs of `NaN` indicates that no data was available for that particular country.

```{R}
joined_data %>% filter(year>2009) %>% select(country,perc_parliament) %>% group_by(country) %>% na.omit %>% summarise(avg_perc=mean(perc_parliament),sd=sd(perc_parliament), var=var(perc_parliament), count=n(),min=min(perc_parliament),max=max(perc_parliament)) %>% arrange(-avg_perc) 
```
Looking at the available data points for 'percentage of women in parliament' after 2009, the mean, standard deviation, variance, count (number of available data points), min, and max values are calculated for each country, respectively, and then arranged in descending order from the greatest average percent of women in parliament. Between 2000 and 2019, Rwanda, Sweden, and Cuba have the highest female representation in parliament compared to the United States, which is ranked 85th and has an average of 20.58%.

According to UNICEF, countries that have reached "gender parity" (or provides equal access to education for both boys and girls) have a ratio between 0.97 and 1.03. Examining only the data from the past decade (from 2010-2019), the following countries still have the greatest disparity in education access between genders:

```{R}
joined_data %>% filter(year>2009) %>% select(-year,-mean_yrs) %>% group_by(country) %>% summarise_all(function(x) mean(x,na.rm = T)) %>% filter(ratio<0.97 | ratio>1.03) %>% mutate(disparity=abs(ratio-1)) %>% arrange(-disparity) %>% head %>% gt %>% 
  tab_header(title=md("**Disparity in Access to Education**"),
             subtitle=md("Quantifying disparity in education and comparing to % of women in parliament")) %>%
  tab_spanner(label="Variables", columns=c('ratio','perc_parliament','disparity'))
```
Disparity was calculated by finding the absolute difference in magnitude between the value of the ratio and 1. Angola, Afghanistan and South Sudan have the greatest disparity in access to education between males and females. It is interesting to note that although disparity in these three countries are the greatest, average female representation in parliament is over 25% in all three countries.
